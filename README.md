> [!NOTE]
> Previous versions of the application can be found in their respective branches and tags.

Simple Task Manager is a basic to-do list web application part of the CMPS2212 GUI Programming course at the University of Belize. It was completed in the 2024-2 semester.

## Application Features

Here are the features of the application:

- Add task
- Update task as complete/incomplete
- Update existing task fields
- Delete task
- Search tasks
- Filter tasks by search term and status
- Sort tasks by priority

## Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS templating engine
- PostgreSQL database

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstration of the application can be found on the following [YouTube video link](https://youtu.be/gLKjjvNg1x8?si=yx7Aebu2EUfmEgiz).

## Running The Application

These instructions assume you use a UNIX-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.). If you are using Windows, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.

### Prerequisites

- `git` command line tool available
- Latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) server daemon running locally
  - `psql` client command line tool
  - `postgres` user with superuser privileges

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository in whichever directory you prefer on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/andreshungbz/simple-task-manager.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder.

```
cd simple-task-manager
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file to use the default credentials.

> [!WARNING]
> The provided `.env` file is for development purposes only. In a production environment, please set different credentials.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Install the Node.js project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Database Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The scripts will only work if your PostgreSQL host-based authentication configuration setting is set to `md5` or `scram-sha-256`. Instructions to change that are located in the [Update PostgreSQL HBA Configuration](#update-postgresql-hba-configuration) appendix section. Otherwise, use the more manual method in the [Manual Database Setup](#manual-database-setup) section.

1. Run the following script. You may be prompted for the `postgres` user and the `stm_user` password (`swordfish`).

```
npm run dbinitiate
```

This will essentially run three separate `psql` commands for creating the database, creating the necessary tables, and inserting some initial data. Depending on your PostgreSQL host based configuration settings, you may be prompted for passwords during the command. The default password for `stm_user` is `swordfish`. To examine the scripts in more detail, refer to the `package.json` file and the `scripts` folder.

At the end of the steps, you will have a `cmps2212_stm` database and a `stm_user` user who is the owner of the database and its tables.

### Start the Application

1. Run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, which keeps track of changes (in production, you would run `npm start`). Take note of the address logged in the console and visit the application in the web browser using that address and port. If you prefer, `http://localhost:3000` also works.

## Application Tests

Some `vitest` tests in the `tests` folder can be run to conduct certain input validation when operating on a task. It uses some `fetch` requests and examines the response headers to ensure they are what is expected. There are some assumptions to note in the comments.

To run the tests, **ENSURE** the server is running, open a new terminal, and run the following command:

> [!NOTE]
> The tests **WILL** fail if the server is not running.

```
npm run test
```

## Miscellaneous Configuration

Some settings, such as port and tasks per page, can be configured in the `src/config/app.config.ts` file.

## Appendix

### Update PostgreSQL HBA Configuration

1. Login to `psql` as the `postgres` superuser and run the following command to find the location of your PostgreSQL host-based authentication configuration file.

```
SHOW hba_file;
```

Return to your terminal and open the file in the `nano` text editor.

```
sudo nano {YOUR_HBA_FILE_LOCATION}
```

For the `local` unix socket connections row, change the `METHOD` is set to `md5` or `scram-sha-256` (better). It should look like this:

```
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     scram-sha-256
```

Save the file, then restart the PostgreSQL server daemon:

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

### Manual Database Setup

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you're in the project root directory.

1. Login to `psql` as the `postgres` superuser and paste the following in the `psql` prompt.

```
\i scripts/setup.sql
```

2. Login as `stm_user` in the new database (password: `swordfish`).

```
\c cmps2212_stm stm_user
```

3. Create the tables.

```
\i scripts/tables.sql
```

4. Insert some initial data.

```
\i scripts/data.sql
```
