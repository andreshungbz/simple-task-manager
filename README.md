Simple Task Manager is a basic to-do list web application part of the CMPS2212 GUI Programming course at the University of Belize. It was completed in the 2024-2 semester.

## Application Features

Here are the features of the application:

- Add task
- Update task as complete/incomplete
- Update existing task fields
- Delete task
- Search tasks
- Filter tasks by search term and status
- Sort tasks by priority

## Technology Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS templating engine
- PostgreSQL database

## Video Demonstration

A video demonstration of the application can be found on the following [YouTube video link](https://youtu.be/gLKjjvNg1x8?si=yx7Aebu2EUfmEgiz).

## Running The Application

These instructions assume you are using a UNIX-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.). If you are using Windows, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.

### Prerequisites

- `git` command line tool available
- Latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) server daemon running locally
  - `psql` client command line tool
  - `postgres` user with superuser privileges

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository in whichever directory you prefer on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/andreshungbz/simple-task-manager.git
```

2. Change the directory to the project folder.

```
cd simple-task-manager
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new `.env` file to use the default credentials.

> [!WARNING]
> The provided `.env` file is for development purposes only. In a production environment, please set different credentials.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Install the Node.js project dependencies.

```
npm install
```

### Database Setup (THE LAME WAY)

1. Login to `psql` as the `postgres` superuser and paste the following in the `psql` prompt:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS cmps2212_stm;
DROP USER IF EXISTS stm_user;
CREATE USER stm_user WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD 'swordfish';
CREATE DATABASE cmps2212_stm OWNER stm_user;
```

2. Login as `stm_user` in the new database

```
\c stm_user cmps2212_stm
```

3. Create the tables

```
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    priority VARCHAR(10) CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

4. Insert some initial data

```
INSERT INTO tasks (title, description, completed, priority)
VALUES
    ('Record Demo Video for Simple Task Manager', 'Record a 10-15 minute video on the GUI project and upload it to YouTube.', false, 'high'),
    ('Complete OOP Tables', null, false, 'high'),
    ('Design OOP Screens', null, false, 'medium'),
    ('Continue C# Learning', 'Read Chapter 4 of the Head First C# textbook.', false, 'low'),
    ('Write Journal Entry 1', 'Submit journal for the internship days this week.', true, 'high'),
    ('Code Simple Task Management Web Application', 'Complete for GUI class homework/quiz/test.', true, 'medium'),
    ('Customize Work Profile', 'Finish setting up work account profile for internship.', true, 'low');
```

### Database Setup (THE COOL WAY)

After much headache, if you want to use my cool scripts to very quickly setup the database, you must ensure your PostgreSQL instance has properly configured host-based configuration settings. This is found in the `pg_hba.conf` file. You can check the location of the file by running the following command:

```
SHOW hba_file;
```

You probably have the `nano` text editor, so open the file to edit it:

```
sudo nano {YOUR_HBA_FILE_LOCATION}
```

For the row for `local` unix socket connections, ensure the `METHOD` is set to `md5` or `scram-sha-256` (better). It should look like this:

```
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             all                                     scram-sha-256
```

Save the file then restart the PostgreSQL server daemon:

```
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```

> [!WARNING]
> These steps set up a database with predetermined names and credentials. In a production environment, please set different names and credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> These steps assume you have the default `postgres` superuser as well as the default `postgres` database. If you have a different setup, you may need to adjust the commands accordingly.

1. Login to `psql` as the `postgres` superuser and paste the following in the `psql` command line to clear any existing database/user and create a new user:

```
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS cmps2212_stm;
DROP USER IF EXISTS stm_user;
CREATE USER stm_user WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD 'swordfish';
```

2. Exit `psql`

```
\q
```

3. Run the following command:

```
npm run initiatedb
```

This will essentially run three separate `psql` commands for creating the database, creating the necessary tables, and inserting some initial data. Depending on your PostgreSQL host based configuration settings, you may be prompted for passwords during the command. The default password for `stm_user` is `swordfish`. To examine the scripts in more detail, refer to the `package.json` file and the `scripts` folder.

At the end of the steps, you will have a `cmps2212_stm` database and a `stm_user` user who is the owner of the database and its tables.

### Start the Application

1. Run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, which keeps track of changes (in production, you would run `npm start`). Take note of the address logged in the console and visit the application in the web browser using that address and port. If you prefer, `http://localhost:3000` also works.

## Application Tests

Some `vitest` tests in the `tests` folder can be run to conduct certain input validation when operating on a task. It uses some `fetch` requests and examines the response headers to ensure they are what is expected. There are some assumptions to note in the comments.

To run the tests, **ENSURE** the server is running, open a new terminal, and run the following command:

> [!NOTE]
> The tests **WILL** fail if the server is not running.

```
npm run test
```

## Miscellaneous Configuration

Some settings, such as port and tasks per page, can be configured in the `src/config/app.config.ts` file.
